This is a proxy API for the University of Cambridge Lookup service. It must be
hosted within the CUDN but may be used to provide access to the Lookup service
for clients outside of the CUDN.

Clients are authorised by means of an OAuth2 token with appropriate scope. See
[the documentation](https://uisautomation.github.io/lookupproxy) for further
details.
